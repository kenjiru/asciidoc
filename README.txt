== Configuration ==

. Set up a new input format or add AsciiDoc support to an existing format at

. For best security, ensure that:
  .. The HTML filter is after the Markdown filter on the "Reorder" page of
     the input format.
  .. Only markup you would like to allow in via AsciiDoc is configured to
     be allowed via the HTML filter.
